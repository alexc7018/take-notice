Add notices to all of your posts & pages at once. Customize where and how they appear.

== Description ==

Take Notice lets you add one or more notice boxes across your entire site. For each notice, you can customize the following:

* Whether to appear on all posts, all pages, or both
* Whether to appear on specific pages, categories, and tags
* Where to appear in the post (above or below the content)
* Color of notice box (grey, red, yellow, green, blue)
* Whether to display the notice title with its content

Take Notice is built using a custom post type, and is fully compatible with WordPress 3.0 and newer. You can add more than one notice at a time, and customize the above settings separately for each one. (See Screenshots for an example.)

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the file and upload the `take-notice` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
