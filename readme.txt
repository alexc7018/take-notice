Add notices to all of your posts & pages at once. Customize where and how they appear.

== Description ==

Take Notice lets you add one or more notice boxes across your entire site. For each notice, you can customize the following:

* Whether to appear on all posts (of any post type)
* Whether to appear on specific posts (of any post type)
* Whether to appear on posts with certain terms (of any taxonomy)
* Where to appear in the post (above or below the content)
* Color of notice box (custom colors or preset palettes)
* Whether to display the notice title with its content

Notices are a custom post type, so they can be managed and edited just like posts. You can add more than one notice at a time, and customize the above settings separately for each one. (See Screenshots for an example.)

== Installation ==

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `/take-notice` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
